# python-video-compressor
Compresses videos to a specified size using ffmpeg and opencv.\
Dependencies get installed automatically.\
If the initial size of a file is smaller than the size to compress to, it will increase in size.\
This only compresses by setting bitrates. Compression quality may be better when using crf, depending on the file.
